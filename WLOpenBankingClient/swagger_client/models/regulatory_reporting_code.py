# REACH The Reach Directory is used to get the a list of ASPSP's which can be reached for a  specific Service. **Sandbox** The following authorization token can be used to test in the sandbox (unlike a real token this one doesn't expire) 97fb13a74c712d8c7a50476e71769eaf  # AIS There are several possible flows (sequence of API calls) to obtain a consent before Account Information data can be retrieved. Which API's are required depend on the ASPSP (the bank of the PSU) and the chosen strong customer authentication approach. The response of an API call will indicate in the Links section which next API call is required to complete the consent request.  **Sandbox** Several AspspId's are available to test specific account information scenario's, see sandbox     documentation.

Which API's are required depend on the choosen `PaymentProduct`, ASPSP (debtor bank) and the chosen strong customer authentication approach. The response of an API call will indicate in the 'Links' section which next API call is required to complete the payment. Both PSD2 and IDEAL payments are supported. **Sandbox** Several AspspId's are available to test specific PSD2 payment initiation scenario's, see sandbox documentation.
